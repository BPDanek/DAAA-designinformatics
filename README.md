To-Do: 
- assess datasets used in NIPS challenges
- use NIPS api to run simple attacks (LSTM)
- look at Cleverhans methods and compare to NIPS
- Generate list of Relevant Conferences to Watch

# Defense with Distilled Networks:
- distilled networks are small networks that learn how to classify based off of large, complex networks. 
The heuristic here is that the distilled network learns how to mimic the classificaiton the big network does, as opposed to performing actual feature extraction from the raw data like the origional network would.
